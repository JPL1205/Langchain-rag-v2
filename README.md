## Install dependencies



1. Do the following before installing the dependencies found in `requirements.txt` file because of current challenges installing `onnxruntime` through `pip install onnxruntime`. 

    - For MacOS users, a workaround is to first install `onnxruntime` dependency for `chromadb` using:

    ```python
     conda install onnxruntime -c conda-forge
    ```



```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Create database

Create the Chroma DB.

```python
python create_database.py
```

## Query the database

Query the Chroma DB.

```python
python query_data.py "How does Alice meet the Mad Hatter?"
```

> You'll also need to set up an OpenAI account (and set the OpenAI key in your environment variable) for this to work.
